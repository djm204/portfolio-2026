title: "ADR-001: Migration from Legacy Windows/C++ to Edge-First Vercel Architecture"
subtitle: Legacy Windows/C++ to Edge-First Architecture Migration
status: Completed
timeline: 6 months
impact: 80% cost reduction, instant deployments, improved reliability
---

## Problem

The legacy infrastructure relied on a Windows/C++ stack that was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain, slow to scale, and difficult to deploy. Key challenges included:

- **High Operational Costs**: Infrastructure overhead consuming 40% of engineering budget
- **Manual Deployment Cycles**: Multi-hour deployment windows prone to human error
- **Limited Scalability**: Windows Server instances difficult to scale horizontally
- **Technical Debt**: Bloated systems requiring constant maintenance
- **Deployment Risk**: Manual processes increased risk of production incidents

## Solution

We decided to migrate the frontend and middle-tier "Verify" application to an Edge-first architecture on Vercel, backed by AWS (S3, RDS, Lambda) for core services.

**My Role**: Strategic teardown of legacy infrastructure and cleanup of bloated systems to ensure a lean transition.

**Architecture Decisions**:

- **Edge-First Deployment**: Leverage Vercel's Edge Network for global performance
- **AWS Backend Services**: S3 for storage, RDS for databases, Lambda for serverless functions
- **Incremental Migration**: Phased approach to reduce risk vs. big-bang migration
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated provisioning and deployment pipelines

## Outcome

- **Cost Efficiency**: Achieved an **80% reduction** in infrastructure costs, freeing up engineering budget for feature development.
- **Velocity**: Shifted from manual, multi-hour deployment windows to **near-instant Edge deployments**, enabling rapid iteration.
- **Reliability**: Reduced the attack surface and failure points inherent in managing Windows Server instances, improving overall system stability.
- **Scalability**: Transformed from handling 10K to 1M+ concurrent users with minimal infrastructure changes.
