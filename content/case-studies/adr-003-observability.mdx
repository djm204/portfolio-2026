title: "ADR-003: Standardizing Observability with Axiom and Sentry"
subtitle: Centralized logging and error tracking for Edge-first architecture
status: Completed
timeline: 3 months
impact: 90%+ MTTR reduction, proactive monitoring
---

## Problem

Post-migration, the decentralized nature of Edge functions and AWS Lambdas made debugging difficult. We lacked a "single pane of glass" for logs and real-time error reporting, leading to increased Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) during incidents.

**Key Challenges**:

- **Distributed Logs**: Logs scattered across Vercel Edge, AWS Lambda, and RDS
- **No Centralized View**: Difficult to correlate errors across services
- **Slow Debugging**: Manual log searching increased MTTR
- **Reactive Monitoring**: Errors discovered by clients before engineering team
- **Limited Context**: Missing stack traces and request context

## Solution

We standardized our observability stack on **Axiom** for log aggregation and **Sentry** for error tracking.

### Axiom Selection Rationale

- High-performance querying of structured logs
- Cost-effective ingestion from Vercel and AWS
- Real-time log streaming and analysis
- Excellent integration with Edge functions

### Sentry Selection Rationale

- Deep integration with React/Next.js
- Comprehensive stack traces for Edge-side failures
- Real-time error alerts and notifications
- Source map support for production debugging
- Performance monitoring capabilities

**Implementation**:

- Centralized log aggregation from all services
- Automated error tracking with context
- Real-time alerting for critical errors
- Dashboard setup for key metrics
- Team training on observability tools

## Outcome

- **SRE Efficiency**: The "Verify" application team could identify and resolve production regressions in **minutes rather than hours**, dramatically reducing MTTR.

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Established automated alerts that allowed the team to fix errors before they were reported by enterprise clients, improving customer satisfaction.

- **Debugging Velocity**: Comprehensive stack traces and log correlation enabled rapid root cause analysis, reducing incident duration.

- **Cost Optimization**: Axiom's efficient querying reduced log storage costs compared to traditional solutions while improving performance.
